## Part 3: Web interface for hotel manager

Create a front-end only site for a hotel manager where guests can choose from a list of rooms to book.

You only need to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No web server is required.

The initial layout has already been provided for you in the [hotel.html][hotel-html] and [styles.css][hotel-css] files. From this base, build the modal and add interactive behavior with JS.

Note: the "Confirm" button in the modal doesn't need to do anything. Just leave it as a placeholder button.

### Wireframe

Clicking on the "Book" button for any room opens the "Booking" modal.
